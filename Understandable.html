          <h3>Techniques to build understandable web sites based on the guidelines</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Provide readable and understandable text
              <p>Content must be readable and understandable to the broadest possible audience and not just by viewing the content but also when it’s been perceived by other assistive technologies such as screen reader. The Website’s author must:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Programmatically determine the language of the page</li>
                <li>Provide definitions for technical content and abbreviations</li>
              </ol>
              <p> Example: At the start of the html document the author must include this line so that the document language is indicated.</p>
              <p> &lt;html lang = “document_language”&gt;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Make content operate and appear in predictable ways
              <p>Page navigation should be constant and consistent. This means that the main navigation mechanism must be repeated on multiple pages and appear at the same locations. Also, repeated user interface components must always have the same meaning and different components must have different meanings</p>
              <p> ADD EXAMPLE</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Help the users to avoid and correct their mistakes
              <p>Most common mistakes on a website appear on interactive forms. To help users avoid such mistakes fields must be labelled with clear disruptive text and all the required elements must be indicated. Also, if a form is submitted with error alert the user with adequate error messages to find the error and correct it.</p>
              <p> ADD EXAMPLE</p>
