        <h2> Perceivable </h2>
        <p> Perceivable principle states that information and user interface must be available to the users in a way they can perceive. The majority of users perceive the web content primarily visually, but other might use hearing or touch senses. Nowadays, new emerging technologies may include sensors from smells and taste as well.</p>
        <h3> Guidelines under "Perceivable" </h3>
        <ul>
          <li> Guideline 1.1: Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.</li>
          <li> Guideline 1.2: Provide alternatives for time-based media. </li>
          <li> Guideline 1.3: Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure. </li>
          <li> Guideline 1.4: Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Examples of “Perceivable” principle </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A website contains a chart diagram that contains vital information. The information contained within the chart diagram must be provided in other forms so that is not only visually perceivable.</li>
          <li>A website must have sufficient contrast so that the background can be distinguished from the text by all users including colour-blind and low-vision users. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Techniques to build perceivable web sites </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Provide text alternatives for non-text content.
            <ul>
              <li>Iincludes equivalents for images, buttons, icons, charts, video and audio</li>
              <li>In case of an image the “alt” tag must provide a text alternative equivalent to that image. If the image has no valuable meaning the “alt” tag must remain empty. The words within the alt text must be concise and on point.</li>
              <li>Useful for users with visual impairments and use assistive technologies such as screen reader and improves search engine optimization. Also useful with slow internet connection.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>EXAMPLE !!!!!!!! this will be in a container and the text will be next to the image. </p>
          <img src = "images/sunny_intervals.jpg" alt = "need to figure this out!!!!!!!!!!!11">
          <p> &lt; img src = example_pict.jpg alt = "sunny intervals" &gt;</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    </header>
